# About me

![Erik Samuelsson](../../content/images/erik-samuelsson.jpg)

My name is Erik Samuelsson and I am a professional web developer from Malmö, Sweden.

I am one of those geeks who sits in front of the computer all day long. Coding, browsing Reddit, playing online games or drooling over new tech on blogs. I’ve always loved everything IT related and have been building and tinkering with software since I was a kid - especially web related.

At Lund University I studied information systems with focus on informatics.

I love structure and perfection, both in code and in visual elements. I can spend days just configuring the color theme in my terminal to be the sexiest ever. Occasionally I have to leave restaurants if I find out they’ve written the menu in Comic Sans.

## Skills and work

I'm a front-end developer at heart interested in creating good UI/UX for the web with pixel perfection shooting through the roof. I love structure and re-usability and believe the code should look as good as the site itself. I have worked full-stack a lot and as long as I have a Mac with an open terminal I'm good to go.

I primarily work with front-end JavaScript (currently a lot of React) but I have experience in many web related areas. For example building APIs, NodeJS, databases, CI/CD and web servers.
