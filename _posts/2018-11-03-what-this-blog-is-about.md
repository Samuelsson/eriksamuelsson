This blog is mainly for documenting my own coding and what I learn through my journey as a web developer. The topics
will be a good mix of everything but mostly code related and probably with a focus on front end. What I've listed as
work and skills under my [about page](/about/) is probably a good guess what will show up here.

So until next post, peace!
